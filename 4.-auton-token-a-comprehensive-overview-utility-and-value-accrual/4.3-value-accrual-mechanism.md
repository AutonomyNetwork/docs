# 4.3 Value Accrual Mechanism

The AUTON token accrues value through various mechanisms designed to drive demand and reduce supply:

#### A. Demand Generation

The utility of AUTON tokens in accessing services and participation in governance ensures a consistent demand for the token.&#x20;

#### B. Staking

The holders can stake AUTON tokens to earn rewards, effectively reducing the circulating supply of tokens and increasing the value of the remaining tokens.

#### C. Burning Mechanism

A fraction of the tokens used to pay for services on the Autonomy platform are 'burned' or permanently removed from circulation, thus reducing the total supply of tokens and driving up the value of existing tokens.

#### D. Token Vesting

Tokens allocated to the team and early contributors are subjected to vesting schedules to prevent sudden influxes of tokens into the market.
