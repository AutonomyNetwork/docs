# StakeDAO

As Proof-of-Stake is increasingly becoming the favored consensus algorithm, It is clear that the crypto is moving towards a staking mechanisms. Meanwhile, the emerging DeFi landscape keeps gaining great momentum regardless of the market fluctuations. New financial methods are popping up to top tire VC firms enabling lending, borrowing, staking, derivatives, playing with the interest rates and more.

By StakeDAO's, one can maximize their returns as a passive income. StakeDAO's can enables services like Stake Pool, Validator-as-a-Service(VaaS), etc.  Staking pools are formed with investors(delegator) sharing revenue, locking up their funds for a fixed period of time, they are then able to collect rewards as a passive income. 

In traditional companies all the revenue generated will be directed to that company itself, where as in StakeDAO, the revenue generated by the bunch of DeFi services will be distributed to the  shareholders. The process goes as follows

1. **Shareholders provide their collateral** on one(or more) DeFi services provided by the StakeDAO. Collateral include Ethereum, Tezos, Cosmos Network, Kusama, Polkadot and more.
2. After a set of cycle duration, **Staked DAO Tokens(SDT) are disbursed to all the delegators** proportionally to the amount of fees generated for the DAO's service. The staking yield will be disbursed as usual in the same staking cryptocurrency. This cycle duration may vary based on the decision taken by the majority SDT holders.
3. Later, SDT holders can stake their earned SDT to receive the fees collected by the DAO as a staking reward. 

SDT holders will be granted governance rights over the DAO, letting holders modify the specific parameters like adding new DeFi services, changing the SDT disbursement rate or cycle duration amongst others.

### **Architecture**

StakeDAO provides a verity of DeFi services. It actively incentivizes it's users by grating SDT of the US-denominated fees that are generated through the Stake DAO services. Investors/delegators will continually receives the SDT token as long as they maintain their investment.

Disbursement of the SDT token will occur on a cyclic basis determined by governance. At end of each cycle, amount is determined based on the current percentage that the investor has contributed and thereby the calculated amount SDT will be distributed.

Investors delegate their amount to services provided by the StakeDAO. All commission/rewards generated by these services will be converted to dollar-pegged stable coin on a cyclic basis. SDT holders then have a option to lock their funds to a smart contract to receive the proportional dividends from the stable coin cash back pool. Indirectly this SDT token, services the SDT holder to receive discount in the commission they were charged by the SDT DeFi service. 

Investors can choose to sell their SDT in order to get a new asset. The one who has SDT has rights to participates in the governance to change the rules like current interest rates or cycle duration etc.

### Cross-Chain Investment Registration

StakeDAO services will supports the networks both connected to Ethereum and non-ethereum such as Cosmos, Tezos etc. This is solved by the simple address mapping technique.

Investors from a networks other than Ethereum simply signs a message with their private key from the chain where the investment exists and then sends the signed message to register the investment with the on-chain SDT disbursement contract.

Once each investment is mapped to an address, each cycle newly minted SDT is sent to the mapped ethereum address.

### Liquidity Derivatives

When an investor provide the liquidity for the DAO service, 1:1 pegged derivatives for that liquidity called as Liquidity Tokens (LToken) will be minted and sends him. Each LToken will be liquid use of a locked assets enabling for example, locked assets transfer.

In normal staking pools, users cannot use the locked assets. They must wait for the unbonding period to complete, may thereby be subjected to radical price volatility.

StakeDAO will address this problem of holding, leveraging and transferring staked DeFi assets with long unbonding duration via a bond-style maturity mechanism. Such LTokens will expire on a certain future date corresponding with the staking asset's unbonding period, at which time the locking assets will become available along with the accumulated interests.

These LTokens are exchangeable for the assets. The one who has LTokens will be able to receive the unlocked assets along with the accumulated interests at the time of maturity date.
