# Autonomy Network Documentation

### [Overview](./)
## <h2 align=center>Internet of Communities</h2>
Autonomy is a community owned network (CON) to decentralize your community.

Internet platforms of today are build by centralized organizations where value creators neither get substantial ownership nor governance rights. 

Decentralized communities on the autonomy network can change this by issuing a community token on our blockchain infrastructure.
